Question: Does the Happy Apartments Property advance housing goals?
Context: [lowIncomeUnits: 25%, veryLowIncomeUnits: 10%, totalUnits: 70, advanceHousingGoalsPercent: 30%]
Based on the provided information, the Fairfax Units property does advance housing goals by 30%.
This is the percentage of the loan that is considered Mission-Driven business.

The MAE’s estimations are based on a prescribed FHFA formula for determining the affordability of units based
on the geographic location of the property as well as the rent and unit mix within the property. The MAE then
converts the affordability information into the percentage of the loan that is considered Mission-Driven
business.

Here is an example of how percentage of affordability is calculated per FHFA’s formula:
[Annualized Rent + Utilities] / [AMI * Bedroom Factor] = Unit Percent Affordability

The key details are:

1. There are 70 total units in the property.

2. The percentage of low income units rented to families earning at or below 80% of AMI is 25%.

3. Additionally, the percentage of very low income units rented to families earning at or below 50% of AMI is 10%.
