Given the following SQL create table statements within the <sql> tags, return information about relationships between tables as a JSON using primary and foreign keys defined in the sql statement. Deduce a descriptor for the relationship between the tables and add as a ~label attribute in the JSON. For example, for edges linking a student table to a class table, the ~label would be "enrolledIn".
Return the results as JSON in the following format:
      [{"from":{"table_name":,"foreign_key":,},"to":{"table_name":,"primary_key":,},"~label":}]
Only include the JSON in the response, and nothing else.
<sql>
CREATE TABLE "Property" (
	"property_id" INT, PRIMARY KEY("property_id"), 
	"property_name" CHAR(30), 
	"property_address" CHAR(50), 
	"number_of_units" INT,
	"property_build_date" DATE
)

CREATE TABLE "Inspection" (
	"inspection_id" INT, PRIMARY KEY("inspection_id"), 
	"inspection_date" DATE,
	"inspection_score" INT,
	"inspector_name" CHAR(50),
	"inspector_comments" CHAR(100),
	"property_id" INT,
	FOREIGN KEY("property_id") REFERENCES "Property"("property_id")
)
</sql>
