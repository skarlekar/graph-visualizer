Instructions: Use only the context provided in the <context> tags and schema of a graph database provided in the <schema> tags to perform your task.

<context>
{content}
</content>

<schema>
{neptune_schema}
</schema>

Task: Generate cypher queries to load data from the provided context with the schema provided. The following principles should be followed:
1. Nodes should follow the schema provided above exactly. All properties, node labels, and relationship labels should be found in the schema.
2. Merge queries should be used to find matches to nodes previously added to the databases. The merge queries should match a node based on the name of the node. Address nodes should instead use the full address to find a match. 
3. Each merge query should either create a new node with properties extracted from the content, or update an existing node with properties extracted from the content.
Do not provide any explanation or description. Only return the cypher query.


Here is an example output:

<example>
MERGE (p:Property {property_name: 'Sample Gardens'})
ON CREATE SET p.managementCompany = 'Generic Managers Company', p.occupancyRate = 0.97, p.propertyUse = 'The property has a club room.', p.yearBuilt = 1995
ON MATCH SET p.managementCompany = 'Generic Managers Company', p.occupancyRate = 0.97, p.propertyUse = 'The property has a club room.', p.yearBuilt = 1995;

MERGE (a:PropertyAddress {city: 'Mid City', state: 'OH', streetAddress: '123 Sample Street', zip: '23445'})
ON CREATE SET a.city = 'Mid City', a.state = 'OH', a.streetAddress = '123 Sample Street', a.zip = '23445'
ON MATCH SET a.city = 'Mid City', a.state = 'OH', a.streetAddress = '123 Sample Street', a.zip = '23445';

MERGE (p)-[:hasPropertyAddress]->(a);
