<schema>
{neptune_schema}
</schema>

Task: Generate cypher queries to load data from the provided context with the schema provided. Nodes should be merged into the graph, a match to a previously added node is found when the previously added node matches the new node's name. Only the name should be used to match nodes, all other properties should not be used to match nodes. If a match is found, properties should still be updated, if a match is not found, a new node should be created. Double check that only the name is used to match nodes in MERGE queries, unless the node represents an address. Double check that if a match is found, the node's propertie are updated. Do not provide any explanation or description. Only return the cypher query.
