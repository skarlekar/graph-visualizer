Given the following SQL create table statements within the <sql> tags, create a list of headers for loading Apache TinkerPop Gremlin data using a CSV. Include Gremlin Data Types within the headers. The primary key for each table should become the ~id header. Do not include foreign keys.
Return the results as JSON in the following format:
[{"table_name":,"mapped_headers":[{"sql_attribute_name":,"gremlin_header":]}]
Where the sql attribute name to gremlin headers are defined in the mapped_headers list for a given table.
Only include the JSON in the response, and nothing else.
