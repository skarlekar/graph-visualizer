entities and concepts extracted from the given story context into a single unified cluster. The nodes represent entities like the monkey, crocodile, berry tree etc. as well as conceptual nodes like friendship, trust and betrayal. The links capture the key relationships between them, and the groups provide a rationale for clustering related nodes together. The overarching \"Knowledge\" node with links to all other nodes ensures a single interconnected network.", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "stop": "\n\nHuman:"}
