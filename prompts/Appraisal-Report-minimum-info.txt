Property Description
Summary of Site Characteristics and Improvements 
SITE
Drainage: Drainage appears adequate for the subject property. Drainage 
on the subject site is currently achieved by natural run-off and 
storm water drainage infrastructure. The subject property is 
considered typical with regard to other existing, older multi-
family properties in the subject market area and is one of many 
that have these characteristics.
Utilities: Electricity: Electricity is on site.
Sewer: Municipal Sewer is on site.
Water: Municipal Water is on site.
Natural Gas: Natural Gas is on site. 
Underground Utilities: None.
Adequacy: Utility service is considered adequate for the subject 
improvements and is at least standard for the subject market 
area.
Flood Zone: The subject is located in an area mapped by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The subject property 
appears to be located entirely in Flood Zone ‘X’ as noted by the 
following: 
FEMA Map Number: 12091C0390H, dated December 6, 2002
Easements: We were provided a copy of a boundary survey site plan of the 
subject property. Our review of the boundary survey, as well as 
the appropriate maps, and public records for the subject property 
revealed two easements, as recorded by Okaloosa County Clerk 
of Courts. Central Telephone Company of Florida has a 250'
easement in place along the north boundary and 585' along the 
west boundary, as recorded in ORB/PG 1191/652. S. E. Streets 
holds a 12' wide ingress/egress easement along the southwest
boundary at a distance of 53.25', as recorded in ORB/PG 
1212/763. In consideration of the property and the physical 
location, this type of easement would not adversely affect the 
value opinion of the subject contained herein. 
This appraisal assumes no other easements, encroachments, or 
private deed restrictions which would adversely affect the value 
of the subject property.
Encroachments: We were provided a copy of a boundary survey and site plan for 
the subject property. Our review of these documents, as well as 
the appropriate maps, and public records for the subject property 
did not reveal any encroachments on the subject site. Our 
personal viewing of the site did not indicate any encroachments 
that would adversely affect the value opinion of the subject 
contained herein. 
This appraisal assumes no easements, encroachments, or private 
deed restrictions which would adversely affect the value of the 
subject property.
