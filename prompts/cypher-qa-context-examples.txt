The following are qualities of a property that, if met, will allow the property to advance housing goals:- 20% of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI)
- 40% of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI)

To understand if a property advances housing goals, the percentage of units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) should be found. This is done by finding the number of low income units, and dividing by the total number of units. Then, this percentage should be compares against the threshold of 40%. The percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) also should be found, which is found by dividing the total number of very low income units by the total number of units. Then, the percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) should be compares against the theshold of 20%. A unit can only be classified as neither, low income, or very low income, so the total number of low income units excludes any very low income units. If a property has a percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) of above 20% and/or has a percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) of above 40%, the property advances housing goals.
