Given the following property in the <newPropertyContext> tags, relevant information about other properties within the <otherPropertyContext> tags, and the user question provided in the <userQuestion> tags, answer the user question.

The following are qualities of a property that, if met, will allow the property to advance housing goals:
- 20% of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI)
- 40% of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI)

To understand if a property advances housing goals, the percentage of units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) should be found. This is done by finding the number of low income units, and dividing by the total number of units. Then, this percentage should be compares against the threshold of 40%. The percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) also should be found, which is found by dividing the total number of very low income units by the total number of units. Then, the percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) should be compares against the theshold of 20%. A unit can only be classified as neither, low income, or very low income, so the total number of low income units excludes any very low income units. If a property has a percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) of above 20% and/or has a percentage of all units in a property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) of above 40%, the property advances housing goals.

When asked if we have seen the property before, the given property's address should be found. Then, a property with a matching address should be found from the other properties within the <otherPropertyContext> tags. If one of the other properties has a matching address, the new property has been seen before. Then, the other properties approval decision, approval date, and approval notes should be returned.

When asked if a property qualifies for a Green Loan, the following steps should be taken

There are two ways to qualify for a green loan
Certification Method:
1. Find the property has a green building certification and the green building certification agency
2. If the green building certification is yes and the green building certification agency is one of the following, the property qualifies for a Green Loan
Green Building Certification Agencies:
- BREEAM USA
- Build It Green
- Enterprise Community Partners
- Green Building Initiative

- International Living Future Institute
- Passive House Institute
- Phius (Passive House Institute US)
- U.S. Department of Energy

- Upgrading to ENERGY STARÂ® appliances
- Upgrading boiler
- Replacing inefficient lighting
- Installing solar systems
- Installing water-saving irrigation systems
- Improving insulation
- Making other energy- & water-saving improvements
2. Find the property's annual energy consumption reduction commitment and the property's annual water consumption reduction commitment, if either value is at or above 30%, the building qualifies for a Green Loan
Finally, return if property is a green loan and justification, and mention that this information is extracted from High-Performance Building Report.

<userQuestion>
Does the property advance housing goals?
</userQuestion>
<modelResponse>
There are 70 units in the property. The property has 25 low income units. As a result,(35/70)= 0.50, 50% of all units in the property rented to families earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Since the threshold to help housing goals is to have above 40% of units as these units, this property advances housing goals.
