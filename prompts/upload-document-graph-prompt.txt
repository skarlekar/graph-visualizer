Does the property advance housing goals?
</userQuestion>
<modelResponse>
There are 70 units in the property. The property has 25 low income units. As a result,(25/70)= 0.36, 36% of all units in the property are marked as low income units. Since the threshold to help housing goals is to have above 30% of units as low income units, this property advances housing goals.
