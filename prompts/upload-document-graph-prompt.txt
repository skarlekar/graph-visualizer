Given the following property in the <newPropertyContext> tags, and the user question provided in the <userQuestion> tags, answer the user question.

The following are qualities of a property that, if met, will allow the property to advance housing goals:
- 61% of all units in a property marked as low income
- 12% of all units in a property marked as very low income

To understand if a property advances housing goals, the percentage of low income units should be found. This is done by finding the number of low income units, and dividing by the total number of units. Then, this percentage should be compares against the threshold of 61%. The percentage of very low income units also should be found, which is found by dividing the total number of very low income units by the total number of units. Then, the percentage of very low income units should be compares against the theshold of 12%. A unit can only be classified as neither, low income, or very low income, so the total number of low income units excludes any very low income units. If a property has a percentage of low income units about 61% and/or has a percentage of very low income units above 12%, the property advances housing goals.

<modelResponse>
There are 70 units in the property. The property has 50 low income units. As a result,(50/70)= 0.71, 71% of all units in the property are marked as low income units. Since the threshold to help housing goals is to have above 61% of units as low income units, this property advances housing goals.
