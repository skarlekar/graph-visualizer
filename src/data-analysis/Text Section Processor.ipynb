      "deducting the estimated depreciation, if any, from all sources (physical, functional and\n",
      "economic).  To the result is added the land value, derived from market data, to arrive at a value \n",
      "estimate for the property appraised.  This approach is based on the premise that a\n",
      "knowledgeable purchaser relates value to cost and will not pay more for an existing structure \n",
      "than the cost of creating a similar structure in a comparable location.\n",
      "The Cost Approach can be most useful when dealing with new structures or with special use \n",
      "property.  The reliability of the this approach lessens when appraising older property as the \n",
      "estimation of deprecation becomes increasingly speculative.\n",
      "Cost is not necessarily synonymous with value, therefore, the Cost Approach can rarely stand on \n",
      "its own, i.e., the value indicated by this approach must be supported by one of the other\n",
      "approaches.\n",
      "The subject improvement does not constitute a specialty, rather it is an improvement which will \n",

      "approach provides a poor index of value as it does not relate to the income potential of the \n",
      "property.\n",
      "The Income Approach typically involves projecting the income and expenses of a property\n",
      "over a period, or periods, of time into a cash flow projection before debt service and\n",
      "depreciation.  The cash flow (net operating income) is then capitalized into a value estimate.\n",

      "market. This approach is applied to income producing property, as this type of property is traded \n",
      "based on the quality and durability of its income stream.\n",

      "The subject is located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, the most desirable residential area \n",
      "of the Bronx.  Its exclusiveness arises from its geography (fronting on water on two sides, a \n",
      "highway forming the other border as well as its lack of public housing projects that are typically \n",
      "found in other areas of the Borough.  Riverdale is comprised of one and two family dwellings \n",
      "(some selling in excess of $1,000,000) and mostly elevatored apartment buildings built after \n",
      "World War II.  Most of these buildings are located along the Henry Hudson Parkway as well as \n",
      "along the banks of the Hudson River.  Many of these properties have been converted to tenant \n",
      "ownership (either Co-ops or Condos) and are therefore effectively removed from the rental \n",
      "market.\n",
      "Our analysis of this market indicated that there are approximately 60 elevatored apartment \n",
      "buildings located within 1 mile radius of the subject property, comprising a total of 8,616,000 SF \n",
      "of apartment space (appr. 8,600 units).  Of these 60 buildings, approximately 40 have been \n",
      "converted to Co-ops or Condos, therefore the rental market is approximately one-third of the \n",
      "total apartment market.\n",
      "Furthermore, Rent Regulations in the City tend to discourage moving.  Tenants in buildings with \n",
      "over 5 units built prior to 1974 are governed by Rent Stabilization Guidelines.  This allows the \n",
      "tenant (and their heirs) the automatic right to renew their lease at a fixed annual increase which \n",
      "is set by the State (presently 4%).  However, upon vacancy, the Landlord has the right to receive\n",
      "a vacancy allowance (18%) plus 1/40th of the cost of approved renovations to the unit in order to \n",
      "increase the rent.  If the “Market” Rent of a vacant unit is above $2,000 per month, the unit \n",
      "becomes Deregulated.\n",
      "Thus, it is possible that if a family rented a 3 bedroom apartment in Manhattan in 1950 and never \n",
      "moved out, their grandchildren could be paying $500 per month for an apartment, that if vacant, \n",
      "could rent for $5,000 per month.\n",
      "The more desirable the building and its location, and the larger the apartments (less need to \n",
      "move out due to expanding family size), the lower the average rent.  Furthermore, this system \n",
      "tends to discourage Landlords from providing additional amenities that will increase costs\n",
