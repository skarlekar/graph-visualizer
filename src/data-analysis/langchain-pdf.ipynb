No prior year taxes are reported delinquent. \\n \\nSale History: \\n \\n \\nPer Okaloosa County Public Records ORB/P 2056/1595, \\nthe subject parcels were purchased by Okaloosa-Walton \\nCommunity College Foundation, Inc. from the grantor, \\nRamonde R. Williams on March 1, 1997 for a reported \\nconsideration of $785,000.  This appears to have been an \\narm’s length transfer, at least nominally consistent with \\nthen-current market value. \\n \\nParcels 05-1S-22-256C-0009-0010 and 05-1S-22-256C-\\n0004-0010 were improved at time of purchase with the \\nRaider Housing improvements. Parcel 05-1S-22-256C-\\n0003-0010 (1.44 ac), was subsequently developed in \\n2007 with the College Courtyard Apartments.  \\n \\nNo transfers of the subject property have occurred within \\nthe three years prior to the effective date of this appraisal. \\n \\n',\n",
